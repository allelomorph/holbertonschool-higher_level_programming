translations and reflections.

Attempted virtual backtracking without recursion. In local tests process will
start to slow down visibly for N > 8, and is successful up to N = 11 but
will be killed if used for N > 11. Recursion could allow for a lighter weight
process, but it's not yet apparent to this student how to retain a record of
which solutions are already derived with that method.
